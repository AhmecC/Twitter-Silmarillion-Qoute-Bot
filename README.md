Follow the Twitter Bot : https://twitter.com/SilmarillionQo1

I used the second answer to this thread: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4576077/how-can-i-split-a-text-into-sentences to split up the Silmarillion into sentences. I then randomised the sentences and created Sentences.txt. Speechmarks may be missing from some qoutes, and there may be spelling mistakes (attributed to the source i used). The bot is running 24/7 on replit (paid) and tweets every 3 hours

Updates:
[22/07/22 - Added functionality to like own tweets]
