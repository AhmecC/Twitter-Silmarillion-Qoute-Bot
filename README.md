# Twitter-Silmarillion-Qoute-Bot

I used the second answer to this thread: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4576077/how-can-i-split-a-text-into-sentences to split up the Silmarillion into sentences. I then randomised the sentences and created Sentences.txt. Note that speechmarks may be missing from some sentences, and thus some qoutes may not make sense.
