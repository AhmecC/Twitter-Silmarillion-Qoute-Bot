**Description:**
> This [bot](https://twitter.com/SilmarillionQo1) posts quotes from the J.R.R Tolkien book the Silmarillion every 3 hours.


**Updates:**
> - 22/07/22 - Added functionality to like own tweets

**Upcoming Updates:**
> - Generate Quotes on Images instead
> - Ability to like posts on feed


**Notes:**
> I used the second answer to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4576077/how-can-i-split-a-text-into-sentences) thread to split up the Silmarillion into sentences. I then randomised the sentences and created Sentences.txt. Speechmarks may be missing from some qoutes, and there may be spelling mistakes (attributed to the source i used). The bot is running 24/7 on replit (paid) and tweets every 3 hours
